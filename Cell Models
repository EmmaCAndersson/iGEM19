# Cell Models

GEMs will be used to investigate the cells metabolic flux and growth. Two models will be created:
- One containing the eight genes that are used in the project (bphA1, bphA2, bphA3, bphA4, bphB, bphC, bphD, bphK, pcbA5)
- One containg further reactions in addition to the eight genes, degrading the PCB into Pyruvate
