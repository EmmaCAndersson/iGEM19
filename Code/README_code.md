# Description
This directory will contain all of the code used for the modeling part of the iGEM project. 
There are two subdirectories, where different files are located.

## GEMs
Here you will find the files necessary to create a genome scale metabolic model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae contiaining the genes required for the degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls, as well as to run simulations with this model.

##  Reactor Model
This will be a model of the envisioned product, visualized as a reactor.
