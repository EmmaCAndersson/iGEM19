# Description
This file will contain all code used for the modeling project. Below, you can find a description of the purpose of the parts:

## GEMs

Complete_GEM
- This model will be a GEM of S. cerevisiae, also containing the eight reactions which are also used in the iGEM wet lab project. 

Extended_GEM
- This model will be an extention of the Complete_cell_model, with additional pathways for further conversion of PCB into pyruvate.

##  Reactor Modeling
This will be a model of the envisioned product, visualized as a reactor.
