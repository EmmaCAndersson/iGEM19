To create the GEMs in this file, you will need the yeastGEM.xml file which we are using in the scripts. You can get it by downloading and extracting the S. cerevisiae GEM, from Chalmers Sysbio department, [here](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/yeast-GEM). 
The yeastGEM.xml file is then found in yeast-GEM-MASTER/ModelFiles. Move it to the directory you are working in.
