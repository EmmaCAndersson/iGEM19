## Description
This modeling project aims to analyse the potential outcome of iGEM 2019, Team Chalmers Gothenburg's project.

Team Chalmers Gothenburg, iGEM 2019, strives towards using *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* for degradation of polyychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), by transforming the yeast with nine foreign genes (bphA1, bphA2, bphA3, bphA4, bphB, bphC, bphD, bphK and pcbA5).

## Directories

* Code: Holds the code for the different parts of the modeling project.
* Bin: Includes external models, scripts or programs applied in this project.
* Results: Contains figures and tables obtained from the code.
